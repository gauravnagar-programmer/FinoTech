##### FINOTECH #######

FinoTech is a simple Hindi-first financial awareness and planning web app designed 
to help rural families avoid high-interest loans, understand EMIs, plan savings, 
and discover relevant government schemes — all in a clean, easy-to-use interface.

Along with personal finance guidance, FinoTech introduces a powerful community-based 
money system where villagers can contribute to a shared fund (pool) and borrow money 
from it at very low interest. This creates financial security within the village, 
reduces dependency on local moneylenders, and builds a transparent, trust-based 
community finance model.

This prototype was built overnight for a hackathon to demonstrate how rural finance 
can be made simple, community-driven, safe, and accessible for everyone.

##  Problem

Rural families often rely on:

Local lenders charging extremely high interest

No transparent loan system

No community-based financial trust

No record of who contributed how much

No fair borrowing process in the village

Villages already have trust systems — but no digital tool supports it.


🎯 FinoTech’s Mission 

To bring community-driven finance into a simple digital dashboard, where villagers can:

Build a shared money pool

Contribute together

Borrow from the community at very low interest

Maintain transparent records

Automatically calculate return, interest, and remaining pool balance

FinoTech digitizes “Village Community Finance System” to reduce dependency on moneylenders.
